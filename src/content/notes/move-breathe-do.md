I've been debating writing my thoughts out in the most vulnerable way possible for some time now but something always stops me. Sometimes, I think what's stopped me is crippling fear of saying something cringe that'll live forever on the internet but really it's uncertainty about how it will be received. Is my imposter syndrome kicking in? Will this only get 2 views? Who's going to judge me for this? There's no shortage of excuses I can make.

As I write this now, I find it quite therapeutic. It's so easy to generate a wall of text now through your favorite chat robot but writing something down takes patience and thought. I'm giving this first go without the shackles (does spell/grammar check still count 😅?). Speaking of therapy, some techniques I've learned recently in therapy have helped me start to rebalance my ADHD and anxieties in a really meaningful way.

## Move

My morning routine is generally doom scrolling for a few minutes through the latest chaotic news, doing a little prep to start my day and its go-go-go from there. This was true when I was an engineering leader in big-ish tech, where my calendar was always full, to now as I take on more clients with my development agency, Crown Dev Studios. Mix this with a never ending to-do list of tasks amongst those meetings, and sometimes I'll find myself peeking out the window and its already dark outside. I have forgotten to eat (Adderall is the OG GLP-1), and hours have passed by without me getting out of my seat.

Flow state can be great but I'd probably describe this more as chaos state where my brain is constantly ping-ponging between different contexts and the little mental exercise I get is some memes on Twitter (I refuse to call it X). This is where the first reminder comes in, **MOVE**. Take that 15 minute walk around the block. If I'm hungry, don't just throw something in the air fryer / oven combo thing, but actually take the time to cook something for myself. Activating my leg muscles to get up and move is a kickstart to helping my brain break out the cycle of monotony. Feeling the wind in my face or completing that cooking task, no matter how simple and easy it sounds, is fuel.

## Breathe

When departing Block last year, I had so much anxiety about what the next stage of my career should be after I take some much needed time away. Is this the one time in my life where if I don't jump now, I'll miss the opportunity to be a founder? Should I go back to building as an Individual Contributor (IC) at a frontier lab. Should I continue the manager's path? Should I put a prototype I've been toying around with out into the world? So many questions and with each one, an increasing amount of pressure I'm putting on myself.

Then there are the new tools and workflows that launch practically every day. Every time I invest in a new workflow and start to feel the boost, I'm bombarded with another one I'm told I should be adopting. I've felt a similar sentiment to this tweet so many times.

[I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2004607146781278521)

I don't know about you but when I have all these raging thoughts kicking around, this typically causes me to overthink. If I'm ever talking when in this mode, it'll be at 2x speed.

That's where the second reminder comes in, **BREATHE**. I've heard that recommendation countlessly but have never been good at implementing it but a friend recommended [Meditate Yourself Happy](https://www.amazon.com/Meditate-Yourself-Happy-Minutes-Meditation/dp/1784886076) to me last year. Not quite [Jack Dorsey level](https://x.com/jack/status/1071575088695140353) but these simple meditation rituals helped me pay attention to my thoughts more carefully and allow me to be deliberate in my choices in what to give my attention towards. I'm still working on it but I definitely notice subtle differences in my body and clarity in my mind when I'm able to do that.

Breaking out of that monotony to move allows me to focus on my breathe and how I'm feeling inside.

## Do

Tech Twitter is a fascinating place. It truly is a niche community but there's non-stop FOMO and announcements about somebody launching a new open source project or blog or a fund raise or a robot that can do the dishes upside down. It's exhausting but also sometimes I can't look away feeling like I'm missing out on the fun. But I have to ask myself, why is this even a feeling I have at all when I know how the algorithm works?

Honestly, those insecure questions are a reflection on me. You have to focus on what you can control and with the tools made available to me now, I can produce so many things that I wasn't able to before in minutes, not days. But where do I start?

Do I revive that college Master's project where I was [simulating a robot play soccer](https://learning.miami.edu/14-cas-robocanes/index.html)? Maybe I should focus on world models to get ahead of the next AI craze where I missed out on LLMs! Should I contribute to an open source project that has a lot of eyes? Should I build that Mac utility I always wanted? Should I build an agent prototype because that's where all the hype is? Again, a bombardment of questions but with no concrete answers which can lead to an endless sprawl.

And that brings me to my last verb, **DO.** Build one thing at a time. No matter how small. A quote from this excellent article titled ["Our Souls Need Proof of Work" by Julie Zhuo](https://lg.substack.com/p/the-looking-glass-our-souls-need?utm_source=publication-search) really stood out to me.

[Our Souls Need Proof of Work](https://lg.substack.com/p/the-looking-glass-our-souls-need)

> Work hard for yourself, for the joy you feel when you're one step closer to the person you've always wanted to be

There's nothing that is more fulfilling and rewarding than doing the thing you always wanted. My thesis for the best products to build are centered around this core idea that while most of the narratives are geared around what agents can take off your plate, humans still find meaning in the act of achieving goals themselves. In a world where knowledge is becoming more decentralized and credentials mean less, I want to build products and tools that help people see the artifacts of their own creation.

Personally, this is the start of one of those journeys for me today. I'll be sharing a lot more about technical things and some of the fun stuff I've been building but writing my sporadic thoughts has been a step 0 for me for some time.

**P.S.** This post was one-shotted by me while listening to [Gamma waves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLEek3I3wac) which my partner just recently introduced to me. Highly recommend for focus!
